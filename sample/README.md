This is a sample Android project featuring AIDL2.

------

Only the following files are different from the default project template to enable AIDL2:

* `/build_aidl2.rb` --- Will be included after running `rake`.
* `/.externalToolBuilders/Build-AIDL2.launch` --- Define how to launch the `build_aidl2.rb` program.
* `/.project` --- Define how to run the Build-AIDL2 builder.

The application itself is a simple test case to check if the interfaces generated by AIDL2 work correctly. If everything works fine, it should show 11 green "PASS" blocks on screen.
